CAP4730 Final Project

Project Report: See project_report.pdf

Description:
This application allows you to interact with a 3D scene by changing
various aspects of the camera's perspective projection, such as the
frame of view, near clipping plane, and far clipping plane.  It also
allows the user to view three different models and toggle their
wireframe on or off.

In order to run the program, you will need to open index.html
on a local server.  A simple guide to running a web server can
be found here: https://gist.github.com/jgravois/5e73b56fa7756fd00b89
In order to view the web page locally, I simply used the
atom-live-server package in my atom text editor.  This package
allows you to launch an http server with just one click.  If you
do not run the page on a local server, you will not be able to view
the box and plant models.
